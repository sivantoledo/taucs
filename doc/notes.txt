Additional build notes
======================

Under Windows, I used the following shell commands to set up the command line for VS 2022 and MKL:

call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" intel64

(For VS 2019, use
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
)

I added win32_mkl and built with variant=_mkl module=!METIS
